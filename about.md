I am some guy trying to get back to school. I like to program, I like to math, I like hardware and most importantly I love to squat. Right now I'm working at some minimum wage slave job to fix my previous screw ups, but one day I'll make it out of here! What got me into programming is emulators. I love reading about how they work and looking at optimization work over time. So far I've only contributed to bug reports and minor bug fixes(like forgetting to break in a switch statement =P) but one day when I get the time I will jump into the scene. I also like to model in 3d and want to write an opencl realtime raytracing game engine some day or adapt luxrender for the purpose of gaming. I'm sure photorealism is possible with today's hardware given how parallelizable the Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithm is. It might take a couple GTX 980s though haha.  

### Contact me pls
