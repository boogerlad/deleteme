Canton Chilli has changed my life permanently. At first, I was relunctant to eat there. I was weary of eating at expensive subpar restaurants in Toronto. My first impression walking in was this place is extremely generic. Undersized tea cups, white plastic sheets on the table, carpet floor. The menu didn't look too exciting either, but I was recommended the Chilli Chicken dish. While waiting for my order to arrive, I noticed that the walls were plastered with napkins of gratitude, thanks and amazement. Why? This is just a restaurant. I couldn't be more wrong. The food was fantastic. I have never experienced food like this. What a strong flavor! Words are not enough to describe the experience. I have befriended the staff and eat there as often as possible.

Canton Chilli is not just a restaurant. It is a way of life. Once you accept it in your life as the truth and as your personal savior, there is no turning back. Canton Chilli is my number one priority in life. When I am pursuing a romantic relationship, Canton Chilli is the first thing that is introduced. It's like a triangle. The closer my partner and I are to Canton Chilli the better. We will meet in the middle. If we don't, it was never meant to be.

Every moment I think about Canton Chilli. It has become my life. Even in my dreams, it is there. Follow the teachings of Canton Chilli. Believe. In time, you too will become wise like I have. Once you accept Canton Chilli into your heart, you will be enlightened. It is the way. It is the light. There are no others. Other Chinese restaurants are false.
